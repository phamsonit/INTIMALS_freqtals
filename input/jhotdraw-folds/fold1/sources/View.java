/**
 * A <em>view</em> paints a document on a {@code JComponent} within an
 * {@link Application}.
 * <p>
 * The document is identified by an {@code URI} (for example a text document
 * which is identified by the URI {@code "file://home/readme.txt"}).
 * If the same {@code URI} is opened in multiple views, the application sets
 * a 'multiple open ID' on the view, so that the user can distinguish between
 * the views.
 * <p>
 * The life of view objects is managed by an application. See the class
 * comment of {@link Application} on how to launch an application.
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of a view consists of the following steps:
 * <ol>
 * <li><b>Creation</b><br>
 * The application instantiates the view object by calling {@code newInstance()}
 * on the class of the view.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Initialisation</b><br>
 * The application calls the following methods: {@code setActionMap();
 * setApplication(); init()}.
 * Then it either calls {@code clear()} or {@code read()} on a worker thread.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Start</b><br>
 * The application adds the component of the view to a container (for example
 * a JFrame) and then calls {@code start()}.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Activation</b><br>
 * When a view becomes the active view of the application, application calls
 * {@code activate()}.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Deactivation</b><br>
 * When a view is not anymore the active view of the application, application
 * calls {@code deactivate()}. At a later time, the view may become activated again.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Stop</b><br>
 * The application calls {@code stop()} on the view and then removes the
 * component from its container. At a later time, the view may be started
 * again.
 * </li>
 * <li><b>Dispose</b><br>
 * When the view is no longer needed, application calls {@code dispose()} on
 * the view, followed by {@code setApplication(null)} and then removes all
 * references to it, so that it can be garbage collected.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * The interfaces and classes listed below together with the {@code Action}
 * classes in the org.jhotddraw.app.action package define the contracts of a
 * framework for document oriented applications:<br>
 * Contract: {@link Application}, {@link ApplicationModel}, {@link View}.
