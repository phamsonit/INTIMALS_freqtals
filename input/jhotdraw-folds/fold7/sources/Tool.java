/**
 * A <em>tool</em> defines a mode of a {@link DrawingEditor}. All input events
 * targeted to the active {@link DrawingView} of the drawing editor are 
 * forwarded to its current tool.
 * <p>
 * Tools inform listeners when they are done with an interaction by calling
 * the ToolListener's toolDone() method. The Tools are created once and reused.
 * They are initialized/deinitialized with activate()/deactivate().
 * <p>
 * Tools are used for user interaction. Unlike figures, a tool works with
 * the user interface coordinates of the DrawingView. The user interface 
 * coordinates are expressed in integer pixels.
 * <p>
 * A Tool forwards UndoableEdit events to the Drawing object onto which it
 * is performing changes.
 * <p>
 * If a tool does not handle a specific keyboard event, it looks up the
 * {@code InputMap} of the drawing editor and then invokes the
 * corresponding action in the {@code ActionMap} of the drawing editor.
 * A tool can have an InputMap and ActionMap of its own which take precedence
 * over the ones provided by the drawing editor.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * The following interfaces define the contracts of a framework for structured
 * drawing editors:<br>
 * Contract: {@link Drawing}, {@link Figure}, {@link DrawingView},
 * {@link DrawingEditor}, {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.handle.Handle} and {@link Tool}.
 *
 * <p><em>Mediator</em><br>
 * {@code DrawingEditor} acts as a mediator for coordinating drawing tools
 * and drawing views:<br>
 * Mediator: {@link DrawingEditor}; Colleagues: {@link DrawingView}, {@link Tool}.
 *
 * <p><em>Mediator</em><br>
 * {@code DrawingEditor} acts as a mediator for coordinating keyboard input from
 * {@code Tool}s and Swing action objects:<br>
 * Mediator: {@link DrawingEditor}; Colleagues: {@link Tool}, javax.swing.Action.
 *
 * <p><em>Observer</em><br>
 * State changes of tools can be observed by other objects. Specifically
 * {@code DrawingEditor} observes area invalidations of tools and repaints
 * its active drawing view accordingly.<br>
 * Subject: {@link Tool}; Observer: {@link ToolListener}; Event:
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.event.ToolEvent}; Concrete Observer: {@link DrawingEditor}.
