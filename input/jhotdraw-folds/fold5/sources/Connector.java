/**
 * A <em>connector</em> knows how to locate the start point or the end point
 * of a {@link ConnectionFigure} on a connected figure.
 * <p>
 * A connector is created and owned by a {@link Figure}.
 * <p>
 * A connector knows its owning figure. A connector has bounds which describe
 * the area of the figure it is responsible for. A connector can be drawn, so
 * that users can see the bounds of the connector.<br>
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * Two figures can be connected using a connection figure.  The location of
 * the start or end point of the connection is handled by a connector object
 * at each connected figure.<br>
 * Contract: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.Figure},
 * {@link ConnectionFigure},
 * {@link Connector}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * The location of the start and end points of a connection figure are determined
 * by {@code Connector}s which are owned by the connected figures.<br>
 * Context: {@link Figure}, {@link ConnectionFigure}; Strategy: {@link Connector}.
