/**
 * An <em>input format</em> implements a strategy for reading a {@link Drawing}
 * using a specific format from either an {@code InputStream}, an {@code URI} or
 * a {@code Transferable}.
 * <p>
 * Typically the format can be recognized by a Mime type or by a file extension.
 * To identify the format used by a file, an appropriate {@code FileFilter}
 * for a javax.swing.JFileChooser component can be requested from {@code InputFormat}.
 * <p>
 * This interface intentionally contains many identical operations like
 * OutputFormat to make it easy, to write classes that implement both interfaces.
