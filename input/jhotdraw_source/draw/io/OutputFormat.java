/**
 * An <em>output format</em> implements a strategy for writing a {@link Drawing}
 * using a specific format into an {@code OutputStream}, an {@code URI} or a
 * {@code Transferable}.
 * <p>
 * Typically a format can be identified by a Mime type or by a file extension.
 * To identify the format used by a file, an appropriate {@code FileFilter}
 * for a javax.swing.JFileChooser component can be requested from {@code OutputFormat}.
 * <p>
 * This interface intentionally contains many identical operations like
 * InputFormat to make it easy, to write classes that implement both interfaces.
