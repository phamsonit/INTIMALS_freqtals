/**
 * A <em>connection figure</em> connects two figures with a 
 * {@link org.jhotdraw.geom.BezierPath}.
 * <p>
 * The location of the start and end points of the bezier path is defined by
 * {@link Connector} objects, which are supplied by the connected figures.
 * <p>
 * If a connected figure is removed, the connection figure needs to be
 * removed as well. To achieve this, {@code ConnectionFigure} listens to
 * {@code figureRemoved} events sent by the two figures that it connects, and
 * then fires a {@code requestRemove} event to get removed as well.
 * <p>
 * The bezier path of the connection figure can be laid out using a {@link Liner}.
 *
 * <hr>
 * <b>Design Patterns</b>
 *
 * <p><em>Framework</em><br>
 * Two figures can be connected using a connection figure.  The location of
 * the start or end point of the connection is handled by a connector object
 * at each connected figure.<br>
 * Contract: {@link org.jhotdraw.draw.Figure},
 * {@link ConnectionFigure},
 * {@link Connector}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * The control points of the bezier path of a connection figure can be laid out
 * using different layout algorithms which are implemented by a liner object.<br>
 * Context: {@link ConnectionFigure}; Strategy: {@link Liner}.
 *
 * <p><em>Strategy</em><br>
 * The location of the start and end points of a connection figure are determined
 * by {@code Connector}s which are owned by the connected figures.<br>
 * Context: {@link Figure}, {@link ConnectionFigure}; Strategy: {@link Connector}.
